This is the official repository for the Godavaru Discord bot. The main developer is
[@Desiiii](https://github.com/Desiiii) (Desiree üå∫#0611). Below you will find a list of features that come with

# Running the bot
Running the bot is not recommended and while it may be quite simple to do, you will not receive support on
obtaining API keys, filling in config files, or anything else. This bot is mostly here as a reference to see how
I do things, which even so is not the most effective way of doing things.

# Inqueries
If you'd like to contact me about working together on the bot or some other inquery, contact me via my business
email at: `godavaru@gmail.com`. Alternatively, you may message me on Discord. My tag is Desiree üå∫#0611 and my ID
is 267207628965281792. I may not respond at first, but I will almost always see it. üëç

# Thanks ya!
Thanks for using the Godavaru bot! It means a lot to see my own personal creation being used in over **400**
servers!
